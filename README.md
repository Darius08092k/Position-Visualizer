The Posture Correction AR App is a Unity-based augmented reality (AR) application designed to help users improve their posture. By utilizing image recognition technology, users can scan an image representing a specific posture, and the app will superimpose a 3D object demonstrating the correct or incorrect posture onto the real-world environment.
