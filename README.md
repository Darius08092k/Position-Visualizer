# Position-Visualizer
The Posture Correction AR App is a Unity-based augmented reality (AR) application designed to help users improve their posture. By utilizing image recognition technology, users can scan an image representing a specific posture, and the app will superimpose a 3D object demonstrating the correct or incorrect posture onto the real-world environment. As well as posture visualization, three different car objects can be visualized and customized and controlled to the user's desire.

Key Features:

Image Recognition: The app leverages image recognition algorithms to detect and identify specific images related to different postures.

Posture Analysis: After scanning an image, the app provides real-time feedback by overlaying a 3D object onto the user's environment. This object visually demonstrates the correct or incorrect posture associated with the scanned image.

Interactive Feedback: Users can interact with the AR objects to gain a better understanding of the correct posture. This interactive feedback encourages users to make necessary adjustments to their own posture.

Customizable Postures: The app supports multiple posture images, allowing users to target various aspects of their posture, such as sitting, standing, or lifting.

User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to scan images, view AR feedback, and track their progress over time.
